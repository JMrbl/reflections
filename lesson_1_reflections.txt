How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It would help in compare that difference between both versions because it can compare line by line.

Myself as analyst, can compare the difference that I would go to see.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If I could get access to the history of a file, it allows me to explorer older versions that could be contain information
that could be relevant in the present, but maybe not in the past.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros are that you the changes made are saved at your own choice, instead of save it every time after every single change

The cons could be the judgement that you have to do about when commit or not


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think that is a smart idea can save multiples files because in that way changes made to related files are made
at the same time so in would be more easy to track and understand in the future.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With [git log] I can visualize all the commits made on a repository and with [git diff] I can compare two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can control the sequence of changes. So, if I introduce a bug I can easely go back and fix it.
